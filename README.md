# BudgetSheet | May 2022
This is a mobile application I created in Andriod Studio using Kotlin. The application is used as a way to help a user budget their expenses. It allows a user to add an expense and specify a category. Then, it adds it to a list that can be viewed either individually or scrolled through. Finally, a stats page can be shown that shows the total expenses for each category as well as a whole.

The following image is the Inital and Main Interface:
